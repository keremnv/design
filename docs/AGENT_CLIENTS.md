# Ontology Author agent attachment

Attachment is an optional agent workflow, not a Core v1 requirement. No live
model is required for core construction or acceptance. Start with the
[core baseline](CORE_PRODUCT_V1_BASELINE.md).

Install the World runtime from this checkout:

```bash
uv tool install .
```

Run the command from the project root you want the agent to work in:

```bash
author attach cursor
author attach codex
author attach claude
```

Attachment is idempotent and only writes the selected native instruction
surface. It does not add MCP, create a server, copy source evidence, or change
existing client configuration entries.

## Cursor

`author attach cursor` writes or refreshes:

```text
.cursor/rules/ontology-author.mdc
```

It is an always-applied project rule. Existing `.cursor/rules` files and MCP
configuration are left alone.

## Claude Code

`author attach claude` writes or refreshes:

```text
.claude/skills/ontology-author/SKILL.md
```

This uses Claude Code's project-local skill mechanism. Existing skills and
`.mcp.json` are left alone.

## Codex

`author attach codex` writes:

```text
.codex/skills/ontology-author/SKILL.md
```

and adds a marked, replaceable instruction block to the project root
`AGENTS.md`. The block points Codex at the project-local skill, while
preserving all other `AGENTS.md` content. No Codex MCP registration is made.

## Shared capability

All three adapters are generated from the same concise capability contract:

```text
ontology_author/world/CAPABILITY.md
```

The contract tells the agent what a sealed World is, where named Worlds
live, the `construction.py` entrypoint and injected authoring surface, which
grounding invariant is hard, and how to use ordinary filesystem, shell,
Python, and SQLite access. It documents the mechanical construction interface.
It does not prescribe how the agent should conceptualize the domain.
