/**
 * §8.6, the derivation explorer — and §21's unanswered question.
 *
 * Everywhere else the product has said `rests on: lifecycle,
 * temperature_compatible, voltage_compatible` and stopped, which is one hop of
 * an answer to "why is this here" and no answer at all to "what depends on
 * this". Both are the same edge table read from opposite ends, so this surface
 * draws both, transitively, from wherever you opened it.
 *
 * Three things sit here and they are deliberately different in kind:
 *
 * - **The closure** is structure the world declares. It is exact.
 * - **The run** is history the world recorded: the version and cardinality of
 *   every input as it stood the last time this derivation executed, beside the
 *   same relation now. Where one has moved, that is the reason the output is
 *   suspect, named — staleness with an account rather than a flag.
 * - **The candidates** are a search. No table in this world records which input
 *   rows produced an output row, so nothing here claims lineage; what is shown
 *   is which input tuples mention the same referents, ranked by how many. The
 *   SQL beside them is the recorded truth about how they combine.
 *
 * The third is kept visibly separate from the first two because collapsing a
 * search into a structural claim is exactly the failure this product exists to
 * avoid.
