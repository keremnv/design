/**
 * A selected mark spreads its own strokes so their names can be read.
 *
 * Every bond and spoke a mark carries stations its plate a fixed distance out
 * from that mark's rim — `BOND_LABEL_ALONG_PX`, the same station for all of
 * them, because a name must not drift toward the midpoint merely because
 * somebody dragged the other end further away. The consequence is that two
 * neighbours a few degrees apart put two plates in the same place. At rest
 * that costs nothing: nothing is named. Selecting the mark names all of them
 * at once, which is exactly when the pile appears, and a pile of names is not
 * an answer.
 *
 * So the selection spreads them. Each stroke leaves the mark on its own angle,
 * pushed off its neighbours until there is a minimum arc between them, and its
 * plate rides out to the station on that new angle. The names occupy an arc
 * instead of a point.
 *
 * Arc is not always enough. A ring of names spends a fixed budget — 2π — at a
 * rate the station sets, and at the resting station that budget is gone by
 * about five names, whatever order they are put in. So a fan that still has
 * names on top of each other spends the other resource and pushes its stations
 * outward, each stroke capped by its own half-filament. `planSpread` carries
 * the measurements and the property that costs.
 *
 * Four properties keep it a spread rather than a rearrangement, and all four
 * are the product canvas's, ported whole:
 *
 * **Circular order is kept.** Strokes are pushed apart in the order they
 * already stand in, so the fan is the neighbourhood as it was, opened up — not
 * a different neighbourhood with the same members.
 *
 * **Each stroke is clamped.** No stroke leaves its own angle by more than
 * `SPREAD_MAX_DEFLECT`, so a crowded mark fans in place instead of eating the
 * circle, and the direction a neighbour lies in stays true.
 *
 * **The far end never moves.** Only the held end's angle changes. What is
 * joined to what is not up for negotiation.
 *
 * **It is a rest pose.** A mark being dragged would re-solve every frame,
 * which is both expensive and unreadable, so the field snaps back to its
 * chords until the pointer lets go.
 *
 * This is presentation and nothing else. No tuple, position or label station
 * is touched: `filaments.ts` holds each elbow in the renderer, and letting go
 * of the mark puts every stroke back on the line it was always drawn as.

 * Isotonic regression, in place of forty-eight passes of shoving.

 * The general problem here is point-feature label placement, and it is

 * particular fan is that two of the freedoms that make the general problem
 * hard were already given up by the design above: every plate sits on a circle
 * around one held mark, and **circular order is kept**. With position reduced
 * to one number per label and the order fixed, what is left is
 *
 *     minimise  Σ (yᵢ − xᵢ)²   subject to   yᵢ₊₁ − yᵢ ≥ gᵢ
 *
 * — move every name as little as possible, while giving each adjacent pair the
 * arc its plates actually need. Substituting out the cumulative gaps,
 * zᵢ = yᵢ − Σⱼ<ᵢ gⱼ, turns those constraints into `z` non-decreasing, which is
 * isotonic regression: solved **exactly**, in one linear pass, by
 * pool-adjacent-violators. No iteration count, no tuning, and the same answer
 * every time.
 *
 * What that buys over the relaxation it replaces is not speed, though it is
 * also faster — it is that the previous loop had no answer to "did it work".
 * It took forty-eight passes and shipped whatever it was holding when it ran
 * out, which on a crowded mark was still a pile. This either returns the
 * provably minimal fan that clears every pair, or reports that no fan can
 * (`crowded`), and those are the only two outcomes.
 *
 * Two wrinkles the textbook version does not have, both handled here:
 *
 * **The gaps depend on the answer.** Plates are axis-aligned, so a pair needs
 * its widths at twelve o'clock and its heights at three, and `requiredArc`
 * measures at the angles the pair currently holds. So the exact solve is run a
 * few times, each recomputing gaps from the solution before it. Unlike the old
 * loop, every pass is exact *given its gaps* rather than one nudge toward
 * being exact, so this converges in two or three rather than tens.
 *
 * **The circle has no first element.** Isotonic regression wants a line. The
 * seam is cut at the pair with the most room to spare, because that is the
 * join the solve is least likely to want to move across.

   * over random fans at the resting station: three strokes cleared completely
   * in 88% of cases, five in 73%, eight in 39%, twelve in 9% — and the
   * deflection clamp bound in every trial. Relaxing the clamp is not the fix
   * either; at that station an unlimited clamp still only reaches 54% at eight
   * strokes, because the demand exceeds the circle rather than being badly
   * distributed around it. The same sweep at a station of 160px clears 93% at
   * eight and 77% at twelve with the clamp untouched.
   *
   * So radius is the resource, and this spends it against the thing actually
   * being asked for — pairs still overlapping — rather than against a proxy.
   * Each round pushes every station out a step, re-solves, and keeps whichever
   * round left the fewest names on top of each other. It stops the moment none
   * are, so the ordinary two- or three-stroke mark pays for exactly one solve.
   * Each stroke is still capped by its own half-filament, so a name never
   * crosses to the far mark's side and a short stroke simply cannot help.
   *
   * **This gives up "the spread moves a name sideways and never outward",**
   * which the header above claimed and which was true while the fan was
   * angular only. It is given up deliberately: a name that stays at its
   * resting distance and cannot be read has kept a property and lost its job.
   * The far end still never moves, circular order is still kept, and letting
