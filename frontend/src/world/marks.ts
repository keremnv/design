 * a stack of names for a line that has no name of its own. The count stands in
 * for them until someone looks, and the whole difficulty is that it must not be
 * mistaken for one of them.
 *
 * So it is not a plate. A plate is where construction origin lives — filled for
 * SEMANTIC and ADJUDICATED, knocked out for MECHANICAL — and a summary spanning
 * four origins that wore any one of them would be asserting a fifth thing that
 * nothing constructed. What is left is the knockout alone, square, so the
 * filament stops being read under the words without a card appearing where a
 * claim would be. Furniture is never a hit target either: the assertions
 * underneath stay the only things a person can take hold of.
 *
 * Its ink is a name's ink. Muting it was reading furniture as *quieter*, which
 * is a light claim, and light here means proximity to what a person acted on —
 * so a count standing exactly where its claims will stand, at the same moment,
 * was drawn dimmer than them for a reason nothing in the field could name. The
 * count is not a name because it has no plate, which is structure, and
 * structure is what carries meaning here. Legibility is not the axis it is
 * allowed to differ on.
