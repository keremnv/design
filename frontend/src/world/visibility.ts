 * name with its gap intact still reads, while a ghosted ground lets strokes
 * through the whisper.

 * `rankOfLabel`, and the strength pass settles ink from it while the frame
 * author stamps paint order from it — the brighter of two overlapping names
 * is also the one on top. Occlusion flows the other way: marks report their
 * bodies and depth, and a name fully under a mark standing above it leaves
