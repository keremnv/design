/**
 * The schema graph — a World's vocabulary as a picture.
 *
 * This is §7.1, and it is the only whole-World view the spec allows: a schema
 * is a dozen relations no matter how many tuples they hold, so it is safe to
 * draw entire where an extension never is. It answers the first question a
 * person has — *what kind of world is this?* — before they have anything to
 * search for.
 *
 * The same projection rule runs here as at instance level, which is what makes
 * the zoom feel like zoom rather than like four different applications: two
 * referent roles collapse onto a filament with the relation's chip on it, three
 * or more stand the chip on the field with a spoke per role, and a scalar role
 * never becomes a node at all. `projectionOf` decides, once, for both.
 *
 * Layout is deterministic and computed here rather than forced. The graph is
 * five kind discs and twenty chips; a force pass would settle somewhere
 * different on every load, and a schema that rearranges itself when you reopen
 * it is a schema you cannot learn the shape of. Kinds sit on a ring, and each
 * relation sits at the centroid of the kinds it connects, pushed off along the
 * perpendicular when several relations share the same pair — which is what
 * keeps `listing_of` and `offered_by` from landing on top of each other.
 * One or two kinds are not a ring but an axis, and the axis lies along the
 * landscape with the first kind leftmost — see `ringPositions`.
