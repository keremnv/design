/**
 * §9 SHOW, and the epistemic overlay that rides the same marks.
 *
 * Construction origin (who decided this) and derivation mode (how it is
 * maintained) are different questions, and SHOW is the first: four layers the
 * spec names, with mechanical off by default because it overwhelms the
 * semantic seams — at S100 that is not a preference, it is the difference
 * between a vocabulary and a pile.
 *
 * Completeness and staleness are not layers. They are a condition of a
 * relation, painted over whatever layer the mark already belongs to. A missing
 * receipt is not UNKNOWN: UNKNOWN is a declared status, and a BASE relation
 * that was never given a completeness claim is simply not in that vocabulary.
