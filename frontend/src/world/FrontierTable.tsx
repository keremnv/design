/**
 * The legacy Purpose frontier table.
 *
 * Durable governed Obligations have a separate typed read path and table
 * (`GovernedObligationTable` below). Keeping the components near one another
 * shares the table furniture without making either payload pretend to be the
 * other.
 *
 * This surface is the old §8.7 Purpose frontier. Its unresolved rows are the
 * join between what one Purpose demanded and what the world asserted. That is
 * different from a governed Obligation's Resolution status, which is shown by
 * the sibling table and does not require a Purpose.
 *
 * The list is a table because Purpose failures are rows, and it shares the
 * extension's shape, windowing and margin rule so that "a row you can put on
 * the field" means one thing across the product. Governed obligations are
 * fetched by their own read contract and table.
 *
 * In the legacy branch, two granularities are kept apart. The rows are
 * obligations — tuple-level, *this
 * demanded tuple is missing*. The band above them is `requirements` —
 * relation-level, *this is what was wanted of the world at all* — which is
 * where the v1 lineage records the met half of a frontier. See `Asked`.
 *
 * One rule of tone. Resolved obligations are shown, quietly, because the
 * interesting thing about a frontier is where it has moved; unresolved ones are
 * shown at full strength. Neither is coloured. **Absence is not falsehood** —
 * the world has not denied these tuples, it has said nothing about them — so
 * nothing here is allowed to read as a rejection.
