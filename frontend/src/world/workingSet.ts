/**
 * The working set — what is currently on the field.
 *
 * The canvas is not a view of the World. It is a subgraph a person built by
 * asking for things, one expansion at a time, and this module is that
 * construction: which referents and assertions are on the field, where they
 * sit, and what it would cost to add more. Rule 9 lives here — the World is
 * never rendered, only what someone asked for.
 *
 * Two rules the rest of the surface depends on.
 *
 * **Existing marks never move.** Expanding places only what is new, ringed
 * around the mark it came from. A canvas that re-lays-out on every expansion
 * destroys the thing expansion is for: you looked away for a second and the
 * part you were reading is somewhere else. This is the same argument, and the
 * same shape, as `proposalPositions` in the product graph — a proposed node is
 * ringed around what it would attach to, because that placement is a statement
 * about what it connects to.
 *
 * `settle` takes the slack out of each fold afterwards — see `relax` — but it
 * is given the old marks as pins rather than asked to leave them alone, so the
 * rule holds by construction and not by care.
 *
 * **The field is not bounded by count.** Expansions place what the world
 * returns, and the reader counts what is standing. The cost is still known in
 * advance: `/world/referent` returns a count per
 * relation, so the question "what would this cost" is answered before anything
 * is drawn.
