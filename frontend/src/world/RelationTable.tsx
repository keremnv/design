/**
 * A relation's extension, as a table.
 *
 * §11: do not choose between graph and table. The canvas holds neighborhoods —
 * a few dozen marks someone arranged to think with — and the table holds
 * extensions, which at this world's largest relation is thousands of tuples and
 * at a real one will be more. They are two projections of one relation state,
 * and the seam between them is a row: selecting one places its tuple on the
 * field, and a tuple already on the field is marked in the margin here. That is
 * the whole of the two-way binding, and it is enough.
 *
 * **Windowed, and paged from SQL.** Only the rows in view are in the DOM, and
 * only the pages the window has touched are in memory. The scroller is sized to
 * `total * ROW_HEIGHT` from the count the server already knows, so the bar is
 * honest about the size of the relation before a single row has arrived, and
 * scrolling to the middle of a ten-thousand-row relation fetches one page
 * rather than ten thousand rows. Rows not yet loaded draw as ruled blanks: the
 * table's shape never jumps as pages land.
 *
 * **Sorting is the database's.** Changing the order discards the buffer and
 * re-asks, because a sort applied to the pages you happen to hold is not a
 * sort. SQLite orders the largest relation here in well under a millisecond.
 *
 * No table library. What a grid needs is a fixed row height, a spacer, and a
 * slice — thirty lines that we control the type of — and what a library would
 * add on top is a second set of opinions about focus, keyboard and styling to
 * fight with the design language.
