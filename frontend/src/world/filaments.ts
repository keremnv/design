/**
 * The world's filament — a straight stroke whose held end will fan out.
 *
 * G6's `line` draws source to target and nothing else, which is right at rest:
 * a filament is a claim that two referents are joined, and a curve for its own
 * sake would be decoration on a structural mark.
 *
 * What it cannot do is make room. Every bond and spoke a mark carries stations
 * its plate a fixed 44px out from that mark's rim, so two neighbours sitting a
 * few degrees apart put two names on top of each other — and the moment
 * someone selects a mark is exactly the moment every one of those names is
 * revealed at once. The names are the answer; overlapping, they are not
 * readable.
 *
 * So the filament carries one optional elbow near the held end. Off, the path
 * is the chord it has always been — the same two commands, so nothing about
 * the resting field changes. On, the stroke leaves the mark on a spread angle,
 * reaches its plate's station, and runs straight to the far end from there.
 * The plates travel with their strokes, so what was a pile of names becomes a
 * fan of them; the far end never moves, so nothing about what is joined to
 * what changes.
 *
 * The elbow is renderer state, deliberately not graph data. Where a stroke
 * leaves a mark so its name can be read is presentation — nothing about the
 * world changed — and writing it into the data would make every fan a change
 * to the drawing everyone else reads back.
 *
 * Ported from the product canvas's selection fan; `spread.ts` is the geometry
 * that decides the angles.
