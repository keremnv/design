/**
 * The filter menu, remembered between visits — in this browser, for this world.
 *
 * The five SHOW layers plus the three menu toggles that sit with them (names,
 * spread, frame). Like the field store this is display state only: which layers
 * someone left showing says nothing about the world, so it lives in the browser
 * next to the field rather than on the host.
 *
 * Keyed by world **without** revision. A filter names a layer — a stable
 * concept — not a tuple id, so a rebuild does not retire what it means. A new
 * revision keeps the person's filters and drops their field, which is the
 * honest split: the arrangement addressed claims that may be gone, while
 * "mechanical overwhelms me" is still true.
