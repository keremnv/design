/**
 * The field — a referent and the neighborhood someone grows around it.
 *
 * §7.2, and the mode the product actually lives in. What the schema canvas does
 * for vocabulary this does for instances, in the same two marks: discs are
 * referents, chips are assertions, and a bond is a chip that has a line to ride.
 *
 * Three behaviours are deliberate rather than defaults.
 *
 * **Marks are draggable.** A neighborhood is something a person arranges to
 * think with, so nodes are moved by hand and stay where they are put — dragged
 * positions are read back out of the renderer before any rebuild, so growing
 * the field never undoes the arrangement.
 *
 * **Naming lights the bond.** At rest the field is discs and filaments and no
 * words but the referents' own; hovering a disc names what it touches. A
 * filament is not a hover target — pointing at the line does not name it, does
 * not light it, and does not change the cursor. Selection still names, because
 * that is a choice rather than a pass.
 *
 * **Selection is marching ants.** The mark the reader is open on is ringed by
 * travelling beads — the product canvas's selection, brought over whole. It
 * replaces a translucent halo, which on a field of discs read as a smudge
 * rather than as a choice, and it generalises: a disc takes a circle, a plate
 * takes a square-cornered box, and a bond — which has no mark of its own — has
 * the beads march along the filament itself.
 *
 * **Focus only names.** Hover and selection reveal the labels belonging to the
 * subject without fading unrelated matter. This matches the product canvas and
 * keeps scanning the wider neighborhood possible while a relation is named.

     * at all. The ones that remain mark groups nobody has gone to yet, and
     * going to one is a click.
     *
     * The hit test stays, because G6's picker still will not deliver events
     * for these labels — but it runs once per click instead of once per
     * pointer move, and `stopPropagation` keeps the same click from also
     * reaching the canvas and clearing the selection underneath.
     *
     * It reaches bond names as well as counts, and that was the gap. A binary
     * claim has no plate — the name on its filament *is* the claim's only
     * drawing — so while G6 refused those clicks the only way to open one was
     * to find it in a table. Role names on spokes are deliberately not
