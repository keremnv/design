 * stroke that was still whole underneath, which only the next full draw
 * cleared. Driving each part explicitly is what makes an interruption total.

 *
 * The visibility pass's hand: `from` and `to` are absolute fill values — the
 * lane multiplied its strengths by each label's authored base already — and
 * only the text part moves. The plate is untouched, so a whisper keeps its
 * gap; naming's `opacity` is untouched, so a show fade and a yielding never
 * overwrite each other. A name recovering takes `restorePlan`, one yielding
 * takes `weakenPlan`: the arrival and the release, borrowed from the motion
 * the lanes already speak. Absent plans land outright, the reduced-motion
 * rule every painter here follows.
 *
 * Elements G6 has not built yet are skipped, not failed: the store the lanes
 * update alongside already carries the strength, and the element is built
 * from it.
