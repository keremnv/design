/**
 * The vocabulary canvas — §7.1.
 *
 * Lifted out of `WorldPage` when the field arrived beside it: two canvases in
 * one component is how one of them ends up with the other's behaviours. Its
 * first arrangement is deterministic, but it is still a thinking surface:
 * marks can be moved and their positions survive label and selection changes.
 *
 * Selection is the field's, which is the product canvas's: marching ants on the
 * mark's own outline. A relation that stands on the field is a plate and takes
 * a box; one that collapsed onto a bond has the beads run along the filament.
 * The two canvases share the component so they cannot come to disagree about
