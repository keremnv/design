/**
 * A room's camera, remembered between visits — in this browser, for this world.
 *
 * Zoom plus the canvas point at the viewport centre — the pair
 * `getZoom`/`getViewportCenter` reads. Restore zooms, then pans that point
 * back under the centre the way `panToElement` already pans a mark under its
 * target, instant and without a flight. Display state only, like the
 * arrangement stores: it says nothing about the world.
 *
 * A centre, not a pixel offset, so a window resized between visits still
 * frames the same content. (`translateTo` is not the inverse of
 * `getPosition` — measured, it lands elsewhere — so the stored pair is not
 * zoom-plus-translate.)
 *
 * Keyed by room, world **and revision**. A camera frames an arrangement, and
 * arrangements are revision-scoped — a rebuild re-lays-out, and a camera kept
 * for the old layout would frame empty space.
 *
 * Only settled, person-moved cameras are kept. Every transform — wheel, drag,
 * fit, flight — reports through `aftertransform`, so capture debounces to the
 * settled camera, and programmatic moves hold the recorder while they run: a
 * focus flight ends at a mark the next visit will not have selected, and
 * storing that endpoint would spend the person's framing on transient
 * attention.
