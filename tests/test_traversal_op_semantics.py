"""Two ops that compiled, executed, and answered wrongly.

Both were found by running one-shot programs against a real constructed graph
and checking each answer against the same set computed a second way. Neither
is reachable by reading the code: the step validates, the run reports FOUND,
and the number returned is plausible.

`union` had two spellings and only one of them arrived. `of: [$a, $b]` works --
the executor flattens the list -- but `of: $a` with `with: $b` compiled with no
second operand in its params at all and returned `$a`. On a saga graph the
union of two places' casts, eight characters and three, answered eight.

`walk_sequence` applied its `kinds` filter at every hop rather than to its
result. A `character -> event -> place` walk asking for places died on the
first hop, because an event is not a place, and returned nothing -- which this
format's `empty_means: bounded_no_result` states as "there are no such
places". The same walk as two `expand` steps returned three.
