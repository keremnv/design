"""An operator may serve a graph without the tools underneath the vocabulary.

Written for an experiment and kept because the experiment is the use case: a
brief that *asks* an agent not to use `read_cypher` measures instruction
following, not what the graph.md vocabulary can do. Withholding the tool turns
a request into a fact.

Hidden rather than stubbed: a tool that is listed and then refuses reads as a
broken server. A call that arrives anyway is answered with an explicit
`TOOL_WITHHELD` and logged, because whether an agent goes looking for the
escape hatch is exactly the thing worth recording.
