# Ontology Author capability

Ontology Author enables coding agents to construct and maintain bounded
ontologies called Worlds from the evidence in the current workspace.

A World is a bounded semantic abstraction, not a universal model of
the workspace. Its declared scope determines which distinctions must survive;
it does not prescribe schema, relation names, or one correct
conceptualization. Different Worlds over the same evidence may make
different valid conceptual carvings. Shared evidence does not imply
World-level conceptual identity. Do not merge, broaden, or reconcile
Worlds merely because their grounding overlaps. If a needed distinction
is missing inside the same scope, revise construction and rebuild.
Capable intelligence belongs in this conversation; the kernel constrains
durable output. A World may record a purpose as orientation context, but
purpose is not what makes something a World.

A World is a sealed, read-only semantic artifact: named typed relations,
referents, grounding, derivations, explicit unresolvedness, origins,
and revisions. Conversation is the construction control plane. Work with the
user to understand purpose, inspect project evidence, author or maintain
construction, test queries, and rebuild as meaning or evidence changes.

Use ordinary filesystem, shell, Python, and SQLite access. Do not add MCP or a
model launcher. Do not patch `world/world.sqlite`. Use the installed commands:

```text
author create <world-name>            # initialize .worlds/<name>/
author rebuild <world-name>           # construct, validate, and replace world/
author open <world-name>              # inspect locally; remains running
author list                           # discover project-local Worlds
```

`author open` starts a long-running local inspector and remains running until
stopped. It is not needed to verify a successful rebuild; query
`world/world.sqlite` or read `diagnostics.json`.

`author create <name>` creates the World workspace but does not currently
generate `construction.py`. Write that file before `author rebuild`.

If the user has not named a World, choose a concise human-readable name and
tell the user which one you used. Maintain that World's `PURPOSE.md` from the
conversation. Its normal shape is:

```markdown
# Purpose

<a concise agent-authored synthesis of the current purpose>

## User basis

> <an exact, materially purpose-defining quotation from the user>
```

Quote user wording verbatim. Never fabricate or paraphrase text inside quote
blocks. Preserve only purpose-defining statements and refinements, not the
whole conversation. Plain attribution to the conversation is enough; a
harness message reference is optional and must never be required for use.

Keep `construction.py` and any other host-authored helpers or checks in the
World directory. The ordinary project tree is the evidence environment; do
not copy project evidence into `.worlds/<name>/`. Construction may be
exploratory. Rebuild constructs a temporary candidate, validates it, and
replaces that World's `world/` only on success. A failed rebuild leaves the
existing World unchanged. Semantic interpretation, clarification, and
resolution belong in the conversation and enter a later rebuild.

## Construction contract

`.worlds/<name>/construction.py` is the runtime entrypoint. It must define:

```python
def construct(source, world):
    ...
```

An older form also declares a Purpose input:

```python
def construct(source, world, purpose):
    ...
```

That form is legacy compatibility only. The runtime never reads
`PURPOSE.md` implicitly; a Purpose object is created only for an explicit
Purpose request, and legacy three-argument constructors receive `None`
otherwise. The runtime also injects the stable authoring vocabulary into
the construction namespace, so construction need not import these names from
Ontology Author internals:

```text
Role  RoleType  RelationMode  ConstructionOrigin
AssertionGrounding  SourceObservation
Completeness  CompletenessStatus
```

`RoleType` is `REFERENT`, `TEXT`, `INTEGER`, `REAL`, or `BOOLEAN`.
`RelationMode` is `BASE` or `DERIVED`. `ConstructionOrigin` is `MECHANICAL`,
`SEMANTIC`, `DERIVED`, or `ADJUDICATED`. Relation scope is `"WORLD"` or
`"PURPOSE"`.

Construction may use arbitrary additional Python, helpers, and files. This
API is the runtime boundary, not a prescribed construction methodology.

### World

```python
world.add_referent(referent_id, label="")
world.declare_relation(name, roles, mode=RelationMode.BASE, description="", scope="WORLD")
world.assert_tuple(relation, values, origin=..., grounding=None)
world.register_derivation(name, sql=..., inputs=[...])
world.rerun(name, completeness=Completeness(...))
```

`roles` are `Role(name, RoleType.*)` values. `assert_tuple` requires
`origin=ConstructionOrigin.*`. Derived relations are declared with
`mode=RelationMode.DERIVED`, then registered and rerun; do not assert them
directly.

### Evidence

`source` reads the ordinary project tree. Useful operations include:

```python
source.rows(table)
source.read_text(path)
source.fields(table)
source.profile(table, field)
source.distinct_values(table, field)
source.join(left, right, on)
source.grounding(table, location)
```

`on` is a list of `(left_field, right_field)` pairs.

`source.grounding(table, location)` is the usual SOURCE pointer for a WORLD
BASE assertion. `location` is a reconstructible native locator such as a
row key, not copied source content.

### Purpose (legacy explicit-only context)

```python
purpose.unresolved(name, subject={...}, relation=None, reason="")
```

`purpose.require_*` helpers (`require`, `require_unique`,
`require_materializable`, `require_interpreted`, `require_numeric`) are
optional deterministic purpose checks. They are not a required construction
shape. These helpers exist only when a Purpose was explicitly requested;
correctness never depends on parsing `PURPOSE.md` prose.

## Output rules

WORLD BASE assertions require SOURCE grounding.
PURPOSE-scoped records may be ungrounded.
Derived relations are registered and derived rather than directly asserted.
Mechanical validation is a hard output boundary, not proof that the World is
adequate or true.

## Example

The example below uses the legacy Purpose form, so it requires an
explicit Purpose request at rebuild time; otherwise `purpose` is `None`.

```python
def construct(source, world, purpose):
    world.declare_relation(
        "account",
        [
            Role("account", RoleType.REFERENT),
            Role("account_code", RoleType.TEXT),
            Role("legal_name", RoleType.TEXT),
        ],
        scope="WORLD",
    )
    for row in source.rows("accounts.csv"):
        referent = f"account:{row['account_code']}"
        world.add_referent(referent, label=row["legal_name"])
        world.assert_tuple(
            "account",
            {
                "account": referent,
                "account_code": row["account_code"],
                "legal_name": row["legal_name"],
            },
            origin=ConstructionOrigin.MECHANICAL,
            grounding=source.grounding(
                "accounts.csv",
                f"account_code={row['account_code']}",
            ),
        )
    purpose.unresolved(
        "legal_identity",
        relation="account",
        subject={"account": "account:A1"},
        reason="this extract does not establish whether A1 is a legal entity or a trading name",
    )
```

The reusable bundle is `.worlds/<name>/world/` and includes `world.sqlite` plus
its semantic sidecars. A generated `world.construction-receipt.json` records
which `construction.py` produced the bundle. Query it directly with SQLite or
Python. The bundle is portable for semantic consumption; project evidence is
needed for provenance verification, and the World construction state plus
project evidence is needed for reconstruction.
