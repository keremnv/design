"""Read-only projection of a committed `.lbug` for the ambient canvas.

This is a **database read**, not a governance surface. The canvas is a browser
for the knowledge graph — show the map, open nodes, explore — so it must not go
through `MCPSurface` (evidence packets, verdicts, capability gating are the
wrong shape entirely) and it must not touch `engine.get_connection`, which
**auto-seeds an empty database**. `tools/viz_sst.py` already avoids exactly that
trap by opening `real_ladybug` directly; this follows it.

Three things it owns:

- **Map projection** — every node and edge, skeletal. No `text_content`, never
  embeddings: "payloads paged in late" applies literally. Bodies are a separate
  read (`read_node`) when the operator opens a node.
- **Structural facts** — roles and betweenness come from the `.lbug.idx`
  sidecar the engine already writes. Recomputed only when it is missing or
  stale, and then with a connection this module owns.
- **Layout** — server-side, persisted, so every client sees the same map in the
  same place. The FE never lays out (decided 2026-07-27). Arrangement itself
  lives in `graph_layout/`; this module only projects it. Cached in a
  `.layout.json` sidecar keyed by **topology** version.

Decided constraints: the full map, uncapped, no runtime physics and no LOD
bands. Performance is bought with a skeletal payload, a static layout, and
client-side culling — not by hiding the graph from its owner.

See `design [new]/graph-arrangement.md` for the arrangement contract.

#: Bumped when the sidecar shape changes. An older sidecar is a cache miss.
#:
#: 7 — `MIN_DISPLAY_SCALE` moved off tangency, so every cached `display_scale`
#: (and the `overlap` measured through it) predicts a transform the client no
#: longer applies. The arrangements themselves are unchanged; the numbers stored
#: beside them are stale, and a stale metric is the one that reads clean.
#:
#: 6 — the ledger carries `membership_groups`, and a third lens exists. An older
#: sidecar simply lacks the field, so nothing is misread; the bump is so an
#: existing graph is re-examined and offered the new lens if it qualifies.
#:
#: 5 — `ordering.cells` changed meaning. It was `[cell_w, cell_h, cols]`, a
#: uniform cell for the whole grid; it is now `[cols, *column_widths,
#: *row_heights]`, a table sized to its content. The two are both lists of
#: floats, so a stale record does not fail to parse — it is *misread*, and a
#: cached `[4.0, 3.9, 6.0]` becomes "four columns, widths [3.9, 6.0]", which is
#: not wrong so much as meaningless. Nothing would have raised; the map would
#: just have been quietly worse on precisely the graphs that already existed.
#:
#: 4 — records carry `spokes`, and sibling ordering is chosen by measurement
#: rather than by id. The second reason is the load-bearing one: a cached
#: ordering is *preserved* on rebuild, so without a miss here an existing graph
#: would keep the arrangement it already had and never see the improvement. The
#: cost is one deliberate reshuffle per graph, which is what a version bump
#: means.
